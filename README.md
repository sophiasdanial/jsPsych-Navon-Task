# jsPsych-Navon-Task.github.io
This is a testing repository containing jsPsych files (v6.3.1) for Navon Tasks.
There are two types: the first is the Navon-Task-Letters with NO FEEDBACK. The second, Navon-Task-Shapes runs WITH FEEDBACK.
These files were written to be embedded into Qualtrics. I used this repository in 2022 for my Master's thesis

This repository was created based on tutorials by <a href="https://github.com/kywch">kywch</a> and <a href="https://github.com/janakl4us/flanker">janakl4us</a>
